Contains R script, updated codebook, and  prepared data

## Files:
Code Book - Updated.md describes steps taken by "run_analysis.R" to manipulate data into its final, prepared state

run_analysis.R contains the R script used for data preparation in accordance with the assignments requirements:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidyData.txt is a CSV containing the prepared data
